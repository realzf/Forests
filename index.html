      <h2 id="part1"><u>What is Climate Change?</u></h2>
      <p><b>Climate change is the change in usual weather in a place. Long-term
        temperature changes and different weather patterns are the main reasons
        why climate change has even into existence. Throughout history, Earth’s
        climate has changed and is always changing. In some centuries it was warmer
        and in some centuries it was colder. But recently Earth’s natural climate
        change is not the only reason to blame for these changes. Human activities
        have been a major cause of this as well as many of these activities
        create greenhouse gas emissions which heat up the planet. The average
        global temperature has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past
        100 years. Activities like burning fossil fuels, coal, oil, gas,
        manufacturing goods and deforestation are all contributors to climate
        change. Many human daily activities like cooking food and driving
        cars all produce gas which is left to go up into the atmosphere.
        The melting glaciers and rising sea levels are current results of
        climate change which can be seen today. Other consequences include
        flooding, an increase in natural disasters, water scarcity and fires.
        Something must be done about this, otherwise, it might get much worse.
        Some places might start getting extremely hot/cold weather than
        usual. Due to all this, some initiatives have been taken all around
        the world in order to battle climate change. One big initiative is
        to create sustainable forests as this can help decrease CO2 levels
        in the world.</b></p>

      <h2 id="part2"><u>Pakistan's Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Project</u></h2>
      <p><b>In 2019, Pakistan launched a Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Project to fight
        climate change. The goal of this project is to plant 10 billion trees by
        2023 and it was proposed to increase ecosystem restoration, wildlife resources
        and revive old woodland. This will help develop sustainable forests,
        fight climate change and many environmentally friendly jobs will be
        created. Pakistan has been rated as the world’s fifth country most
        affected by extreme weather due to climate change. It has caused many
        issues like heavy monsoon seasons, melting Himalayan glaciers,
        reduced hydropower, extreme heat and flooding, forests are a major
        way to cope with all these issues.<br><br>So far the project has planted
        over 2 billion trees across 10,000 sites. The natural capital in
        the country was decreasing up until this project but it is now
        increasing. Over 1.36 million acres have been covered with trees
        and this number is increasing every day. Pollution has decreased
        as air quality has improved and there is more control over pollution.
        Furthermore, this project has slowed down the rise of greenhouse
        gases as trees absorb these emissions and remove tons of carbon
        from the atmosphere and even improved water quality. Shown on
        the below are two pictures which show a before and after of an area in the Ten
        Billion Tree Tsunami Project.

      <p><b>Tree-Nation is a non-profit organization which promotes tree planting
        projects around the world. Their main goal is to fight climate change
        with reforestation. Tree-Nation’s website states that “Trees are key
        pillars of the world for both humans and the environment. They benefit
        us by purifying water, air and creating better social conditions.
        They benefit the environment by providing homes for various forms of
        life, cooling our climate and improving our soil” [6]. The organization
        uses funds to gather and coordinate people from anywhere in the world to
        plant trees and try to reforest many areas. This initiative has planted over
        22 million trees with 94 reforestation projects worldwide. Around 20000
        hectares of land has been reforested with the help of more than
        440000 people and 10388 companies. The organization believes that its
        efforts will improve water quality and supply, air quality, decrease CO2
        in the atmosphere and ultimately decrease climate change.</b></p>

      <p><b>Tree Canada is a non-profit organization that started in 1982 which
        promotes the planting of trees all over Canada. They strive to restore
        forests to help fight climate change in order for cleaner soil, cleaner
        waterways, shorelines and to decrease carbon pollution. Since the creation
        of this effort, the organization has planted over 84 million trees all
        over Canada. Furthermore, they also aim to plant trees in urban areas
        like schoolyards and housing communities. So far they have made this
        positive impact on more than 700 Canadian communities. They target natural
        areas where human activity has had a negative impact and where trees have
        been cut down and also new areas to create new forests. Also, if a natural
        disaster occurs, Tree Canada is there to help restore any environmental
        damage as shown above. Ice storms hit Ontario and Quebec and Tree
        Canada took the initiative to lead the green disaster relief The organization
        also has a Grow Clean air program which encourages individuals and
        businesses to lessen their impact on the environment by finding
        environmentally friendly options to do their work.<br><br></p>
